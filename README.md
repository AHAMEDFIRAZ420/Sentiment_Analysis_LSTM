Sentiment Analysis with LSTM
Project Description
This project is a sentiment analysis application that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The primary goal is to classify text into different sentiment categories, typically positive, negative, or neutral. This is a foundational task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with broad applications from analyzing customer reviews to monitoring social media sentiment.

The project leverages the power of LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically designed to remember patterns in sequential data. This makes it particularly effective for understanding the context and nuance within sentences, leading to more accurate sentiment predictions compared to traditional machine learning models.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.

NumPy: For numerical operations and data handling.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.

Pip, the Python package installer.

Usage
To use the model for sentiment prediction, run the main script and follow the instructions. The model can be fine-tuned on custom datasets to improve performance for specific domains.
